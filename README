This Package can be used to support the nalysis of HGTD Data originating
from a testbeam or a bench top osciloscope testing with beta source.
Functions should be applid to raw data aquired with the instrument.

More details on the use of specific classes, methods, and utility 
codes can be found on the following TWiki: 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/HGTDUtils

rcSetup Base,2.4.20 # if first time
rcSetup # after that

rc compile

# there are two ways to run it:
# through root [Vagg]
root -l
.x macros/Run.C

# through an executable run, by just:
run [options]
# you need to have either a dir "input" with the initial files
# or set the inputdir to be sth else adding 
run -in newInputFolder 
# there is a default file set to run on 
# but can be changed by 
run -f newFile
# there is the default folder to be created with the output "results"
# but can be changed by
run -out newOutput
# the default operation is "convert" data
# but can be change to "analyze" converted data by
run -do analyze
# and of course combination of all above

The following info is provided for each of the 8 channels:
 t0x             = (vector<double>*) Time vector
 w0x             = (vector<double>*) waveform [voltage]
 vScale0x        = Voltage scale per channel (oscilloscope setting, affects noise)
 nPoints0x       = vector size
 SnRate0x        = sampling rate per channel
